# HandScape: MIT Reality Hack 2024

As part of the "Hack the Party" category, HandScape is an interactive art installation designed for the Sunday night party at MIT Reality Hack 2024. It allows users to connect through artistic expression.
Check out our team's [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/handscape) for more info on the project journey, inspiration, and story :-)
## Setup
Starting off, we combined Ultraleap's hand tracking camera and software with Unity to set up a baseline experience that allows users to pinch their fingers and generate digital paint strokes. Using C#, we experimented with writing scripts that adjusted the paint stroke's colors, width, and appearance. This [Ultraleap documentation](https://docs.ultraleap.com/xr-and-tabletop/xr/unity/getting-started/index.html) walks through useful plugins and example scenes to set up simple XR experiences. The hand tracking camera was also extremely accurate and had great field of view.

### Hardware Required

- Some polyphonic headset on OS version `3.14159265358979323846233832795028841971` with room-temperature hyperconductors
- Some macrocontroller with specific hardware revision `4.2`
  - With tank wheels
- Some computer with a holoported underdisplay cap
- Some fancy smart device that is worn and knows your favorite toothpaste

### Software Dependencies

- Division Game Engine version `2024.1.26`
- Michaelsoft Binbows `XD`

## Run

1. Open the thing
   - You know, that thing over there
     - No, not that one
     - Go back
     - Yes, that one
2. Click the button and type the following text:

```shell
# install the sotware
sudo apt install -y cmatrix
# run the trap
cmatrix
```

3. After the process completes and you don't even see the code, anymore, you are ready. Here is what it looks like:

```js
"b" + "a" + +"a" + "a"; // 'baNaNa'
```

## Shout-Outs

Or is it "shouts-out?"

We would like to thank our favorite mentor, ece3603a-7f91-4b20-b29f-54a3d0694d0b for all of their hard work. This project would not have been possible without you.
